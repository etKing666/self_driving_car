### Objects and the Information Flow

There are two different kinds of objects that are used in the project:

#### Permanent Objects

These objects are created in compile time and they are never killed. For example, car, control unit, LiDAR, Traffic Sign Recognition System and V2V Communication Module are permanent objects and they live as long as the program runs. Because of this, direct reference to object methods are used in the class method definitions.
